## Stand with Hong Kong

This is an open source app and yet it can serve the purpose of keeping track of visit history.

All data is stored locally and none of your personal data is being collected.

The very existence of this app exposes the lies of the Hong Kong government that such an app cannot be developed.


## Stand with Hong Kong
The young generation has done and sacrificed so much for Hong Kong, it is now our turn to do something after escaping to the free world!

1. Setting up of <a href="https://humanetrade.net" target="_blank">Humane Trade</a>, a non-governmental organisation to promote and educate consumers to avoid all Made in China products
2. Launch the cryptocurrency <a href="https://freehk.io" target="_blank">FreeHK.io</a> to replace HKMA, a stablecoin with an open wallet address as foreign reserve
3. Replace businesses across the free world which support the evil communist China regime with companies willing to stand with Hong Kong
4. Lobby in various countries to confiscate assets and to deport the family members of government officials
5. Establish Hong Kong government in-exile to prepare for taking over Hong Kong in the near future

年輕人已經為香港做咗好多犧牲咗好多，係時候由走咗佬去自由世界嘅我哋做返啲嘢啦！

2. 創立<a href="https://freehk.io" target="_blank">自由港幣</a>，以加密貨幣荷包作為外滙儲備，完美取代金管局
3. 抵制全球奶共嘅商業機構，扶植支持香港人嘅良心企業，黃色經濟國際化
4. 游說各國政府充公港共高官嘅外國資產，及將其家屬驅逐出境
